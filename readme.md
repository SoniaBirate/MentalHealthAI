# Mental Health AI

This is my elite (Code2College) qualifier project. I decided to make a project that would benefit individuals, such as putting a smile on their faces or providing materials to help them cope with their anxiety or stress. It includes information on how to cope with anxiety, suicidal thoughts, and also includes a couple of hotlines one could call. 

I plan to continue working on it and to also make it accessible to a huge audience.
